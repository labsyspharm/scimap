*Scimap* is a scalable toolkit for analyzing spatial molecular data. The underlying framework is generalizable to spatial datasets mapped to XY coordinates. The package uses the [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/anndata.AnnData.html) framework making it easy to integrate with other popular single-cell analysis toolkits. It includes preprocessing, phenotyping, visualization, clustering, spatial analysis and differential spatial testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with large datasets of millions of cells.
  
*Scimap* operates on segmented single-cell data derived from imaging data using tools such as cellpose or MCMICRO. The essential inputs for SCIMAP are: (a) a single-cell expression matrix and (b) the X and Y coordinates for each cell. Additionally, multi-stack OME-TIFF or TIFF images can be optionally provided to enable visualization of the data analysis on the original raw images.

*Scimap* development was led by [Ajit Johnson Nirmal](https://ajitjohnson.com/), Harvard Medical School.
